🐦 Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning

📌 Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to classify the sentiment of tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. By analyzing real-time or historical Twitter data, businesses and researchers can gain valuable insights into public opinion about brands, products, events, or topics.

🎯 Objectives

Scrape or use pre-collected Twitter data for sentiment analysis.

Clean and preprocess raw tweet text.

Train and evaluate multiple classification models.

Visualize sentiment distribution and keyword trends.

Build a simple prediction tool for tweet sentiment.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python

Tweepy / snscrape – For Twitter data collection

NLTK, TextBlob, SpaCy – Text preprocessing and NLP

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models
